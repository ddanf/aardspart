== Purpose of "New" Tick Timer ==

It started with "let's get that tick timer out of the status bar..." The folks responsible said "why?" but nobody seemed to care about it like I did, so I brushed off my trigonometry, pulled out my MUSHclient programming manual and said "I can do this!" The result is smoothTick 1.0.

But let's go back to "why?"...

  * Many programs write to the status bar. Some of this information might be nice to have there for more than the 1-2s that typical status bar tick timers allow.

  * When you're waiting for a repop to kill something, even a 1s tick timer can mean the difference between getting that first hit or not. ;)

And so what started as "let's just take the existing tick timer and dump it into a mini-window" has turned into 500+ lines of code to give that mini-window some eye candy. :D
