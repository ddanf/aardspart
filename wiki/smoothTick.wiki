smoothTick 1.0 features:
 * analog tick timer
 * digital tick timer
 * window dragging
 * (almost) full configurability

It started with "let's get that tick timer out of the status bar..." The folks responsible said "why?" but nobody seemed to care about it like I did, so I brushed off my trigonometry, pulled out my MUSHclient programming manual and said "I can do this!"  The result is smoothTick 1.0.

But let's go back to "why?"...
 
Many programs write to the status bar.  Some of this information might be nice to have there for more than the 1-2s that typical status bar tick timers allow.

When you're waiting for a repop to kill something, even a 1s tick timer can mean the difference between getting that first hit or not.  ;)
