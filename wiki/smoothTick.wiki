[http://aardspart.googlecode.com/svn/branches/stable_1_0/Mushclient/worlds/plugins/smoothTick.xml smoothTick 1.0] features:
 * analog tick timer
 * digital tick timer
 * window dragging
 * late tick detection
 * disconnect detection
 * (almost) full configurability

= Why do we need another tick timer? =
It started with "let's get that tick timer out of the status bar..." The folks responsible said "why?" but nobody seemed to care about it like I did, so I brushed off my trigonometry, pulled out my MUSHclient programming manual and said "I can do this!"  The result is smoothTick 1.0.

But let's go back to "why?"...
 
 * Many programs write to the status bar.  Some of this information might be nice to have there for more than the 1-2s that typical status bar tick timers allow.

 * When you're waiting for a repop to kill something, even a 1s tick timer can mean the difference between getting that first hit or not.  ;)

And so what started as "let's just take the existing tick timer and dump it into a miniwindow" has turned into 500+ lines of code to give that miniwindow some eye candy.  :D

= Installation and usage =
 == Download ==
   To download the file, right click [http://aardspart.googlecode.com/svn/branches/stable_1_0/Mushclient/worlds/plugins/smoothTick.xml here] and a menu will pop-up. On this menu, left click the Save link as.... From here, save the file into your MUSHclient/worlds/plugins folder.

 == Install ==
   Once you have MUSHclient opened, you can load smoothtick.xml by either pressing crtl+shift+p or going to File and Plugins. When the window pops up, you will need to go to the bottom of the screen and click the Add button. From here, you will look for the world>plugins folder. Once in that folder, look for the file name you save the smoothtick under and click on it and click Open.

 == Configuration ==
   To adjust your settings, you will need to click on the triangle on the upper left corner of the smoothTick window.
   To move the window, click anywhere other than the triangle and drag.  The following menu options are available:
  * Font - Allows you to change smoothTick's fonts.
   * Title - used for the text that is displayed in the top of the clock circle.
   * Face - Not yet implemented.
   * Digital - used for the digital timer.
  * Transparent - If this is checked, smoothTick's background will be transparent.
  * Colors - The options below allow you to change smoothTick's colors.  To change any of these colors, select the option and then choose the color you want from the color picker and then click ok.
   * Background - The background color.  Setting this to anything other than black will disable transparency.
   * Center Pin - The center pin is the small circle at the center of the clock.
   * Face - Not yet implemented.
   * Hand - The hand is the line that sweeps around the clock face.
   * Marks - Marks (also called facets) are the marks around the outer edge of the clock circle.
   * Menu Handle - The menu handle is the small triangle in the upper left corner of the smoothTick window.
   * Digital - This is the digital part of the clock; the numbers that count down to the tick.
   * Title - The title is the text displayed above the center pin.
   * Late - When a tick is overdue by the late threshold (see below), the digital countdown will change to this color.
   * Disconnected - When a tick is overdue by the disc threshold (see below), the digital countdown will change to this color.
  * Late Threshold - The amount of time that a tick can be overdue by before being considered late.
  * Disc Threshold - The amount of time that a tick can be overdue by before we decide the mud has been disconnected.
  * # of Facets - The number of marks or facets around the outer clock circle.  12 is standard for most clocks.  I have had this number as high as 24000 with no performance impact.
  * Bring Forward - Not yet implemented.
  * Send to Back - Not yet implemented.
  * Help - Not yet implemented.
